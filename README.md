# Idaho-Inflow
Tableau project showing the inflow of population and income to Idaho by state from 2019 to 2020. 

Here is the Tableau Public link to the project:

According to a migration survey completed by United Van Lines, the state with the most inflow of population between the years of 2019 and 2020 was Idaho.

Data is available from the IRS for outflow/inflow for Idaho population between the years of 2019 and 2020:
https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data-2019-2020
The data available for each state includes outflow and inflow by state and county. 

This visualization uses bubbles on the US map to indicate how much population and income (in thousands) came into Idaho from each state between 2019 and 2020. 
Bubble size indicates the size of population from the state, and darker green color means more income was essentially transferred to that state.

Projects of this type could be useful to community planners and the marketing field, for example. 
Where did the newest residents in an area move from? Where did previous residents go? How might the income levels change the previous mean/median income?
